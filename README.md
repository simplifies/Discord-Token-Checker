# Discord-Token-Checker
A free and open-source discord token checker that utilizes proxies, and threading to check the tokens at a fast rate.

## Usage

Depending on your python installation your commands may vary. 
Below are the commands you should run before execution.
The script below auto-scrapes for proxies, then uses them to mass check discord tokens.
Note: The webhook is for sending valid server invites.

The script was tested in python 3.8.6 on windows 10, and Ubuntu 20.04  using python 3.8.5
